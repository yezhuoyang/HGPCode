# HGPCode
This is a repository that implement a playground for hyper graph product QLDPC code. 

The author acknowledge learning a lot from watching the following video:

# Introduction

A Hyper graph product QLDPC code is constructed by two classical linear code C1 and C2. 


# TODO List:

- [ ] Test the correctness by more examples
- [ ] Visualize Surface code
- [ ] Visualize Toric code
- [ ] Visualize BB code
- [ ] Visualize Logical error
- [ ] Visualize different decoding algorithm
